            <p> "The difference between finding and developing your passion is nuanced but crucial, the team argues. 
                Telling someone to “find passion” enforces the idea that each of us has a great passion within us and our life 
                purpose is to realize what that is and be happy. That’s a dangerous mindset because it can limit the passions 
                that a person ultimately pursues — and may prime them to give up if their passion is proving difficult to commodify 
                into a job."</p>
                
                <blockquote><p>“Urging people to find their passion may lead them to put all their eggs in one basket,” the researchers write, 
                “but then drop that basket when it becomes difficult to carry.”</p></blockquote>
      
                <p>"The psychologists say they proved the limiting nature of the “find your passion” mindset through a series of five 
                studies involving 470 participants. Each of these studies tested the choices made by two types of people: those who 
                think their personal interests are fixed (they called this “fixed theory”) or those who believe intelligence and talent 
                can be developed (“growth theory”)."</p>
