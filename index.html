            <h2>The "Why""</h2>
            <p>Our family has compiled a list of products that we researched and found to be overall safe for human usage. To be frank, we may still end up using products that are not be 100% safe because sometimes it's impossible to find a specific product made of organic and harmless materials. The products we will recommend are those that we have loved using in our home. If you have safe products you'd like to recommend for us to share on our website, please e-mail us!</p>

            <p id="hidden">Safe is Different. We use chemicals for a reason: they  make things cheaper, and are available faster. Organic goods are often high quality, but more expensive.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> stain-proofing is really nice, but uses hormone disrupting chemicals. “Waterproofing” something (unless rubber) is inherently chemical and often impossible to do with an organic product.</p>

                <h2> NOT on Amazon</h2>
                <p>Amazon is a flea market. Even if you buy from a “trusted seller” <a href="https://www.redpoints.com/blog/amazon-commingled-inventory-management/" class="linkintext">you might inadvertently receive a counterfeit good.</a>
                    The materials are not verified and you can’t hold anyone accountable for false or misleading purchases. Amazon: “Well, we didn’t sell you that, but we will try our best to make sure it’s up to date!”
                    It's a resellers paradise - there are tons of random “branding hustlers” trying to make a quick buck reselling the same generic crap off of Alibaba. This is why there are many brands sold on Amazon that you have never heard of.
                    Thousands of people buy the same goods from Alibaba, list them as “new brand” to try to set themselves apart, then sell them to you.</li>
                    There is no quality control
