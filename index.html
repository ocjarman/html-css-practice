            <h3>My coding journey</h3>

            <p>Since graduating from college, I immersed myself in the public and nonprofit education sector. I told myself over and over again that I couldn’t be happy unless I was working in a career that I considered ethical, rewarding, and meaningful. To me, that meant helping kids who didn’t have the same privileged upbringing that I had (i.e., 2 parent household, access to great schools, resources, athletics, etc.).<br><br>

            So... I spent my first two years out of college participating in Teach for America in the Metro Atlanta region when I soon learned that teaching in this environment was not sustainable for me. I moved to NYC with my boyfriend, Shane (now, husband) and gave a charter school a try as a special projects manager. Really, I just wanted to move to NYC and this was the best job I could find as an undergrad psych major with 2 years of teaching experience and no teaching certificate (you need a master's degree to teach in NY). A year later, a friend of mine introduced me to her manager at a college access program where I could help low-income high school students get into top-tier colleges across the U.S. I joined SEO Scholars and absolutely loved this job. It was incredibly rewarding helping teenagers in NYC find themselves in various academic, artistic, professional, and athletic opportunities through our organization.<br><br>
            
            But… I knew the time would come when I would move back home with my eventual family and needed a career I could take back to suburban South Florida. I also wanted to get my master's degree because it felt like everyone around me had them and it felt like I needed one too for access to other job opportunities. I needed to make a plan. So, I decided that it was time to go to grad school and become a school psychologist —a noble career helping kids with special needs gain access to important resources. I would be able to work anywhere which was a big plus. I could have a school schedule which would be helpful when Shane and I decided to have kids. It seemed like a win all-around.<br><br>
            
            February 2020, I got into my program at Brooklyn College.<br><br>
            
            March 2020 — COVID-19 hits the U.S. and turns the world (and educational spaces) upside down…for a long time.<br><br>
            
            The entire first year of my graduate program was online. I did great and found that a lot of the classes and work in my program came easily to me. And then…<br><br>
            
            Shane and I got pregnant with our first child, Dean. This made things even more challenging. Although we were planning for our baby around this time frame, we weren't planning on having a baby during a pandemic. And I wasn’t planning on being face-down and sick on the couch for 4 months while working part-time at SEO and going to graduate school full-time. But such is life, you can’t plan for everything (which I am still having difficulty learning!).<br><br>
            
            Dean was born in September of 2021, and since my graduate program was cohort-based and classes needed to be taken sequentially, I had to take the entire year off. This was a bittersweet situation. On one hand, I was elated that I could spend the first year of my son's life taking care of him —which I know is a privilege.* But…this also felt like a setback for my career.<br><br>
            
            The first 4 months of Dean’s life were incredibly difficult. Sleep deprivation was the worst experience of my life, and breastfeeding around the clock was brutal. This is a story for another day. But once Dean started sleeping better and routines started to develop around 6 months, I felt ready to go back to work. But I didn’t have anywhere to go back to.<br><br>
            
            I needed to do something to feel productive mentally. Shane, who is a software engineer, suggested that I learn to code. Partly for fun, as a hobby, or just to do something during the day while Dean napped. So, instead of streaming unlimited hours of TV shows throughout the day, I started to code on Codecademy. It felt so good to be learning something new and challenging. I felt like I was using my brain to solve complex problems instead of calculating how much Dean was sleeping and eating, figuring out what time I needed to go to sleep in order to be functional the next day, or worrying about whether or not I was a good enough mom. It felt like therapy.<br><br>
            
            After a few months of this, Shane and I had a moment where we pondered our next steps. Would we move to a far away but more affordable neighborhood in NY so I could pick up school again? Or should we just move home to Florida where we have the support of our family, and know the neighborhoods and schools well. “You could go to coding boot camp,” he said. Hmm…<br><br>
            
            So one thing led to another and I decided to keep practicing, keep learning, and see how I felt before making a decision. A huge decision! Quitting the graduate program that I was taking $60,000 out in student loans to complete? Would I like coding? Am I even smart enough to do this? I still ask myself this constantly. The perks of a career in tech were pretty enticing. I was fed up with the salary limitations on education workers. On the fence, I spoke with one of my best friends, Jess, who had recently finished the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Jess and I had the same exact job working side by side at SEO a few years back. She had basically doubled her salary by moving into a career in tech. She encouraged me over and over again that I could do this if I wanted to. She suggested I make the jump and take “Bootcamp Prep” at Fullstack Academy to take a more structured class and prepare for the program’s tech interview.<br><br>
            
            April 2022 — I took Bootcamp Prep for several weeks at night once I put my son down for bed. I’d listen in on the class with headphones for the first 30 minutes so that I could ensure his full routine was complete and I wouldn’t have any anxiety about missing night sleep (PTSD from sleep deprivation is real!). I completed the course and went on to schedule my interview with the Grace Hopper program in May. Within a week or so, I found out that I was accepted into the August 2022 cohort.<br><br>
            
            Shane, Dean, our dog (Karat) and I moved to Florida in June 2022. My program started on July 15th. I just passed Foundations (the first phase) of boot camp. And..I guess I’m doing this!<br><br>
            
            My goal is to write about this experience so that if you are on the fence about making a career change, maybe my thoughts on this can help. Maybe not. I don’t know what I’m doing! But, I also know that I wasn’t happy with the other direction I was going in. A career in education is exhausting, oftentimes unsustainable, for very little pay. Although it can be rewarding working with school children, it isn’t always. After having my son, my priorities have shifted. Being able to work remotely, earn a salary that contributes to my family’s future in a larger capacity, and learn new hard skills to increase my job opportunities is important to me. So, this is my new direction.<br><br>
            
            Also — I realize I am privileged enough to be able to make a big, expensive, decision like this. I have a supportive family and a husband who has a job that takes care of us. We are able to afford part-time childcare while I learn to code. We’re hoping this large expense will be an investment in our future in the years to come. But I feel it’s important to acknowledge this.<br><br>
